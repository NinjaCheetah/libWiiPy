    """
    Decompresses the data of an ASH file and returns the decompressed data.

    With the default parameters, this function can decompress ASH files found in the files of the Wii Menu and Animal
    Crossing: City Folk. Some ASH files, notably the ones found in the WiiWare title My Pok√©mon Ranch, require setting
    dist_tree_bits to 15 instead for a successful decompression. If an ASH file is failing to decompress with the
    default options, trying a dist_tree_bits value of 15 will likely fix it. No other leaf sizes are known to exist,
    however they might be out there.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ash_data : bytes
        The data for the ASH file to decompress.
    sym_tree_bits : int, option
        Number of bits for each leaf in the symbol tree. Defaults to 9.
    dist_tree_bits : int, option
        Number of bits for each leaf in the distance tree. Defaults to 11.
