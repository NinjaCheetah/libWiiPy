# libWiiPy.nand.setting Module

## Description

The `libWiiPy.nand.setting` module provides support for handling the Wii's `setting.txt` file. This file is stored as part of the Wii Menu's save data (stored in `/title/00000001/00000002/data/`) and is an encrypted text file that's primarily used to store your console's serial number and region information.

This module allows you to encrypt or decrypt this file, and exposes the keys stored in it for editing.
