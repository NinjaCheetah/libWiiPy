# libWiiPy.nand.emunand Module

The `libWiiPy.nand.emunand` module provides support for creating and managing Wii EmuNANDs. At present, you cannot create an EmuNAND compatible with something like NEEK on a real Wii with the features provided by this library, but you can create an EmuNAND compatible with Dolphin.
