# libWiiPy.archive.ash Module

The `libWiiPy.archive.ash` module provides support for handling ASH files, which are a compressed format primarily used in the Wii Menu, but also in some other titles such as My Pok√©mon Ranch.

At present, libWiiPy only has support for decompressing ASH files, with compression as a planned feature for the future.
