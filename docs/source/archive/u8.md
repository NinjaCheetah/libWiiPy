# libWiiPy.archive.u8 Module

The `libWiiPy.archive.u8` module provides support for handling U8 archives, which are a non-compressed archive format used extensively on the Wii to join multiple files into one.

This module exposes functions for both packing and unpacking U8 archives, as well as code to parse IMET headers. IMET headers are a header format used specifically for U8 archives containing the banner of a channel, as they store the localized name of the channel along with other banner metadata.
